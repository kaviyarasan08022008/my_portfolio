                Hi, I'm <span>Kaviyarasan</span>, a passionate web developer and learner.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello! My name is Kaviyarasan. I have recently completed my 12th grade.
                I am new to the field of web development and currently learning the basics.
                I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend basics using FastAPI. 
                I am interested in understanding how websites and applications work and enjoy
                practicing by creating small projects.
                I am a quick learner and motivated to improve my skills step by step.
                My aim is to grow as a web developer and build useful projects in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, I am focusing on web development and backend technologies 
                like FastAPI and databases. My goal is to become a full-stack developer.
            </p>
